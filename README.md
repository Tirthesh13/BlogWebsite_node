- **Express.js**: Framework for handling routes and HTTP requests.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: Template engine to render HTML pages.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and modern UI.
- **Body-Parser**: To parse form data.
- **fs (File System)**: For reading and writing blog posts to the file system.
